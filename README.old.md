# DVT Tech Challenge
This challenge is part of the hiring process at DVT for frontend developer roles. 
The goal is to produce this without investing any more time than necessary. 
As such, we'd like to see your regular conventions when writing an application.

## Why are we asking you to do this?
At DVT, we try to set our standards high. 
We would love for strong candidates to join our team and help us aim to be the best. 
This challenge is to help us understand your proficiency over a number of facets of development, which we value.

Some of these are
- Good commit & branching conventions
- Handling of network requests
- Typescript
- Routing
- State management
- Framework (Angular, React, NextJS or Django) conventions
- Semantic HTML
- CSS and Styling 
- General ability to produce a polished application, responsiveness is a lower priority, but appreciated

## What do you need to produce?
We're asking you to build a basic storefront using [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/) 
(alternatives such as [JSON Dummy](https://dummyjson.com/docs/products) are also accepted)

We would like for you to get all products and display them as cards on a page, with the ability to add items to a cart.

There is a _lot_ of room to go above the expected outcome, 
and please feel free to tackle something relevant to your current level 
or something you are good at (this would be optional)

_Some_ examples of this would be 
- Using a global state manager in an efficient way
- Multiple routes
- Great visuals
- Authentication

## Some additional notes
- Please be considerate of what dependencies and build tools you are using
- If you opt to use any @ts-ignores or similar, please leave a comment with an explanation
- Feel free to leave comments/notes in your `README.md`

## AI TOOL USAGE
- AI tools are permitted, but please do not use to generate an entire project or implementation
- Acceptable use:
  - Project setup
  - Boilerplate code generation
  - Project scaffolding
  - Project configuration generation
  - Project documentation generation
  - Project testing generation
  - Project deployment generation
  - Project CI/CD generation
  - Code completion
  - Code formatting
- Where AI was used, the understanding and explanation of what has been created is expected

## Submission
- Please use this repo as your submission. 
- Open a finalised pull request for review. 
- Notify us (especially your recruiter) when you are ready to submit.

Best of luck and thank you for taking part in our assessment.
